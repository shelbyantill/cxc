                    <p>As a Student Software Developer at the Center for Analytics and Research in Transportation Safety, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a variety of 
                        real-world software development projects. In this role, I assist in developing full-stack applications, working with technologies like C#, SQL, .NET, and Visual Studio. 
                        I contribute to both front-end and back-end development, helping to build and maintain software solutions 
                        that support stakeholders in the transportation safety sector.

                        I also support existing applications by troubleshooting and testing them, working with large relational datasets, 
                        managing databases, and creating tests for both new and existing features. 
                        
                        Throughout this experience, I’ve been able to collaborate with professionals in the software development field, 
                        learning from their expertise while contributing my own ideas to the team.  </p>

                    <small>May 2024 - Aug 2024</small>
                    <p>During my internship in Houston, I worked as part of an agile development team focused on 
                        Gulf of Mexico applications, where I attended daily stand-ups. My primary responsibility was developing
                         an API in C# and .NET, using Azure Functions to monitor user requests for well data records. 
                         I also implemented garbage collection for Azure
                          Storage to optimize resource usage.

                        Throughout the internship, I had the opportunity to learn from experienced mentors and collaborate with 
                        other interns. My mentors provided valuable guidance in cloud computing, API development, and Azure tools, 
                        helping me refine my technical skills. 
                        
                        This internship not only strengthened my technical abilities in cloud computing and API development, but also deepened my understanding of agile workflows and collaboration in a professional software development environment.

                    <p>During my internship in the Greater New Orleans region,
                         I developed a media-responsive app using Blazor that improved 
                         data management and accessibility for over 400 staff members. 
                         The app utilized CRUD operations to streamline the management of 
                         gemba walk notes. I also integrated Azure Storage to improve the handling 
                         of tank strap data, making it more efficient and accessible. Using version 
                         control, I collaborated with the team to ensure smooth development and deployment.

                        This experience strengthened my skills in Blazor,
                        Azure, and version control, while allowing me to 
                        contribute to a solution that improved operational efficiency for the team.

                        managing up to 512 files and directories. The filesystem 
                        utilized bitmaps to track available space and read/write data on a 
                        simulated disk. This project
                         demonstrated my understanding of file systems and low-level disk management.

                    <p>In my Programming Languages course, I developed a lexical analyzer to simulate a

                        from a simple programming language, using regular expressions to identify 
                        and group lexemes into tokens such as identifiers, constants, and symbols.
                         These token objects were then returned to a mock parser. This project demonstrated my ability

              Service, I share real-world effects, such as the threat to vulnerable communities and endangered species.
            I also highlight solutions for combating climate change, like using alternative 
            transportation, recycling, and supporting eco-friendly policies. I draw inspiration from

            This presentation highlights my experience as a Software Engineer intern at Chevron, where 
            I worked on improving the process for retrieving well data records for Gulf of Mexico users.
             My project involved developing a web interface and API to streamline the document retrieval process, 
             enhancing data security, efficiency, and user experience. By leveraging technologies like C#, 
             Blazor, Azure, and version control tools, I helped automate and simplify a previously manual and 
             error-prone process. Key results included faster document access, reduced storage costs, and improved user satisfaction.

             I  had the opportunity to collaborate with mentors, network with other interns, and gain insights into Chevron's IT operations and career paths.

                <h3>Halliburton Scholars Program</h3>
                <p>I was selected for the Halliburton Scholars Program 
                    for  two academic years, which provided professional development. As part of the 
                    program, I participated in various workshops, career expos, 
                    and networking events designed to help me prepare for my future 
                    career. I participated in  
                     mock interviews, resume reviews, and networking receptions,
                    which gave me the opportunity to connect with professionals
                      and gain insights into the energy industry.

                      This experience helped me
                    network with Halliburton employees and fellow scholars, providing 
                    mentorship and career guidance.

                <h3>Hackathons</h3>
                <p>I have attended several hackathons (through my internships, university, or local events) 
                    where I learned how to quickly collaborate
                     with people from different backgrounds and 
                    skill sets. I learned new skills, such as creating API's, building prototypes, or using
                    new languages/frameworks. Each hackathon offered a different challenge and tested my ability to 
                    build a project in a very short amount of time with a team.
                    Beyond the technical skills, I valued the connections and memories I made with others at these events.

                <p>
                    As a co-leader for the food waste audit with the World Wildlife Fund’s Citizen Scientist program, I helped guide a team in conducting an audit at a local elementary school. Our goal was to measure food waste and identify ways to reduce it, while also raising awareness about its impact on hunger and the environment. I coordinated the project, worked with the school staff, and led our team in gathering data. It was rewarding to see the school take action based on our findings, and the experience deepened my passion for sustainability and food justice.
