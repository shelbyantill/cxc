                        During my internship in Houston, I worked as part of an agile development team focused on Gulf of Mexico applications. My primary responsibility was developing an API in C# and .NET, using Azure functions to monitor user requests for well data records. Additionally, I implemented garbage collection for Azure storage to optimize resource usage. Throughout the internship, I had the opportunity to learn from experienced mentors during daily standups and network with other interns during intern events. This internship strengthened my technical abilities and deepened my understanding of agile workflows and collaboration in a professional software development environment.

                        During my internship in the Greater New Orleans region, I developed a media-responsive app, using Blazor, that improved data management and accessibility for over four hundred staff members. The app utilized create, read, update, and delete operations to streamline the management of Gemba Walk notes. Additionally, I integrated Azure storage to improve tank strap data management, making it more efficient and accessible for staff members. Using version control, I collaborated with my team to ensure smooth development and deployment. This experience strengthened my skills in Blazor, Azure, and version control, while allowing me to contribute to a solution that improved operational efficiency for my team.

                        In my Digital Media Programming course, I created an interactive game where a player controls a hot air balloon with a joystick, utilizing an Arduino. This project expanded my skill set in web game development with visual, audio, and physical user interaction. The goal of the game is to navigate a hot air balloon through a sky filled with obstacles in thirty seconds. The player needs to avoid collisions, and the game becomes more difficult over time as the number and speed of obstacles increase. An LED light changes color to indicate the number of game lives remaining.                     </p>

                    <h3>Hackathons</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have attended several hackathons (through my internships, university, or local events) where I learned how to quickly collaborate with people from different backgrounds and skill sets. Additionally, I learned new skills, such as creating APIs, building prototypes, or using new languages/frameworks. Each hackathon offered a different challenge and tested my ability to build a project in a very short amount of time with a team. Beyond the technical skills, I valued the connections and memories I made with others at these events.

                    <p>
                        
                        As a co-leader in the World Wildlife Fund’s Citizen Scientist program, I guided a team in conducting a food waste audit at a local elementary school. Our goal was to measure food waste, identify ways to reduce it, and raise awareness about its impact on hunger and the environment. I coordinated the project, worked with school staff, and led our team in gathering data. It was rewarding to see the school take action based on our findings, deepening my passion for sustainability and food justice.
